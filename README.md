## Features

- User Authentication with Amazon Cognito
- CRUD operations for users, accounts, transactions, budgets, and financial goals
- Advanced analytics for financial insights
- Data export functionality
- Serverless architecture for scalability and cost-efficiency

## Architecture

This application is built using a microservices architecture with AWS Lambda functions:

- User Service
- Account Service
- Transaction Service
- Budget Service
- Goal Service
- Analytics Service
- Export Service

Data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and the API is exposed through Amazon API Gateway.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate permissions
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-finance-app-backend.git
   cd personal-finance-app-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the SAM application:
   ```
   sam build
   ```

4. Deploy the application:
   ```
   sam deploy --guided
   ```
   Follow the prompts to configure your deployment.

5. After deployment, SAM will output the API Gateway endpoint URL. Save this for use in your frontend application.

## Running Tests

Run the test suite with:

```
npm test
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /user`: Create a new user
- `GET /user/{id}`: Get user details
- `PUT /user/{id}`: Update user details
- `DELETE /user/{id}`: Delete a user

(Similar endpoints exist for accounts, transactions, budgets, and goals)

- `GET /analytics/summary`: Get financial analytics summary
- `GET /export`: Export user's financial data

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](API_DOCS.md) file.

## Security
